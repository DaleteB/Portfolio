      <p>
        I am from Brazil, but I am currently living in Portugal. Since little I
        always dream about living abroad and I fulfill this dream after
        graduating from college.
        <br />
        <br />
        Living in the United States was an amazing experience, where I could to
        grown up so much. I made friends that I will take with me, and memories
        that I cherish forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a fews years I though it was time to live a new experience. Moving
        to Portugal with my family has been amazing, now I can share with them
        all my new memories.
        <br />
        <br />
        I decided to start from zero, with a new carrer. After some incentive
        form my cousin, that is a senior developer. I found SheCodes, and
        through their worshop I learned to have fun coding. I am very excited to
        explore a career as a Front-end developer.
